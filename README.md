# eBookReaderSwitch

This is a project I've recently just started working on again. Currently its using MuPDF as its backend. Currently only most pdf files work.

### Current State:
* It finally works!
* So far, only **MOST** of the PDF files I've tested works.
* Just about **ALL** of the code isn't even mine but taken from an old commit of NX-Shell.

### TODO:
* Fix some PDF crashes and all the other file extentions.
* 2 pages side by side in landscape
* Dark mode
* Hardware lock to prevent accidental touches (maybe Vol- ?) (?)
