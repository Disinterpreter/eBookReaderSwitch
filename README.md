# eBookReaderSwitch

This is a project I've haven't worked on for a while and I'm just now getting back to it. This is a Nintendo Switch Homebrew Application and will read ePub files, or eventually, what ever MuPDF supports.

### Current State:
* Crashes your switch.
* Just about **ALL** of the code isn't even mine but taken from an old NX-Shell repo. 
* Working on redoing the code and making it not crash your switch.

### TODO:
* Use MuPDF.
