# eBookReaderSwitch

This is a project I've recently just started working on again. Currently its using MuPDF as its backend. Currently only most pdf files work.

### Features:
* Saves last page number
* Reads PDF files
* Dark and light mode
* Landscape reading view
* Portrait reading view

### Current State:
* So far, only **MOST** of the PDF files I've tested works.

### TODO:
* Fix some PDF crashes and all the other file extentions.
* 2 pages side by side in landscape
* Hardware lock to prevent accidental touches (maybe Vol- ?) (?)
